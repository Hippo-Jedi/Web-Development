            This assignment wasn't extremely difficult for me. The hardest challenge I faced was getting the image up and looking decently good. It took me awhile to get it the right size and also how to rotate it because initially it was on its side. The only other thing that was challenging was referencing my email address but that wasn't too difficult once I did some research. The main resource I used for help was articles and the internet. Google is the greatest teacher and whenever I was stumped I did a simple good search. I also used Piazza to clarify any questions I had about the assignment but it was pretty straight forward. I learned a lot more about CSS even though I didn't use. I found that majority of the time, it is much easier to have a CSS file to go along with your HTML file. I already knew the basics of HTML which really helped me with this particular assignment and publishing it wasn't too difficult.

            This assignment was very time consuming for me. I spent a lot of time reading through the index file so I could sort out all the different classes. Once I did that, I was able to get a pretty good idea of how the CSS file would look. Then it was a process of trial and error to get the correct margins and padding. The most challenging part for me was getting the twit boxes to move if the window changed size. That took me awhile to figure out but it turned out okay. I learned much more about CSS and how to correctly style an index file which was really fun for me. Seeing all the different ways you can style a button was mind opening. My main resource that helped me was the internet. I basically googled my way through this assignment, the hard part was finding the most efficent ways fit the mocks. One important thing I realized is that there can be multiple ways to style something the way you want it. Here is my <a href="assignment-2-copy/index.html">assignment #2</a>.

          This assignment was by far the most difficult for me. It was hard to get a solid understanding of JavaScript and how to correctly format it. The hardest thing I ran into was the search bar and how to correctly use JS to search the different Tweets. I also took a long time trying to figure out how to make the search bar live and display results as text was entered. I learned a lot more about JavaScript and how to link it with the HTML file. The main resource I used was the internet and Google. I had to google a lot of different things to correctly do what was asked and even more for the extra credit. I used piazza every once in awhile just to see if anyone was having the same issues as me and that was really helpful. Understanding selectors and how to use them was also very time consuming and difficult to comprehend for this assignment. Overall, I think this assignment was the most difficult thus far but it also was the most informative. I was able to learn a lot about the DOM and the overall structure of a common website and the incredible possiblities that you can create.

          This assignment wasn't too time consuming but it did take me longer than I expected. The auto-grading on github really made me confused at first and I struggled understanding the errors I kept on getting. The most challenging part was getting the 404.html file to show when something other than the files were served. I used piazza a lot more than usual for this assignment to see what others were doing to solve some of the issues I was having. I learned a lot more about servers/nodes and how they can be utilized to make things much more efficient. I got the core of the server.js file done pretty quick but it took a lot of researching and guess'n'check to fix some of the problems I was running into. Overall, this assignment was a good brain teaser because at first glance it seems quick and simple but once I got into it I realized the amount of depth that comes with nodes and servers.
