            This assignment wasn't extremely difficult for me. The hardest challenge I faced was getting the image up and looking decently good. It took me awhile to get it the right size and also how to rotate it because initially it was on its side. The only other thing that was challenging was referencing my email address but that wasn't too difficult once I did some research. The main resource I used for help was articles and the internet. Google is the greatest teacher and whenever I was stumped I did a simple good search. I also used Piazza to clarify any questions I had about the assignment but it was pretty straight forward. I learned a lot more about CSS even though I didn't use. I found that majority of the time, it is much easier to have a CSS file to go along with your HTML file. I already knew the basics of HTML which really helped me with this particular assignment and publishing it wasn't too difficult. Here is my <a href="index.html">assignment #1</a>.
